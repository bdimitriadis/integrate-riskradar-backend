<p class = "answerRC mainRCanswer">Be aware that oral sex is considered extremely low risk because saliva doesn’t transmit HIV. However, if you
    have any fresh cuts or sores in your mouth, infected semen, blood or vaginal fluidscan enter your bloodstream
    when you lick or suck a penis, vagina or anus. Remember, what is low risk for HIV is not necessarily low risk for STIs such as syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhoea and LGV; so, getting tested is still important if you are having any kind of sex. Other sexual acts such as fisting and sharing sex toys without cleaning them afterwards can also expose you to hepatitis and STIs. It is recommended to get tested at least twice per year or more often if you have sex often and with different partners.</p>
